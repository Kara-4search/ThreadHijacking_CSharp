# ThreadHijacking_CSharp

Blog link: may not gonna update

- Base on my other projects down below.
	1. [ProcessHollowing](https://github.com/Kara-4search/ProcessHollowing_CSharp)
	
- Injecting malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. 
- Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

![ThreadHijacking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kara-4search/ProjectPics/main/ThreadHijacking_gif.gif)

- Steps
	1. Create a process in a suspended status;
	2. Allocate some executable memory for "shellcode" in the target process with VirtualAllocEx.
	3. Copy the shellocde into the memory with NtWriteVirtualMemory.
	4. Retrieve the target thread's context with GetThreadContext.
	5. Update the target thread's instruction pointer (x64 RIP/x86 EIP register) to point to the shellcode, which was written into the target process's memory in step 3.
	6. Commit the hijacked thread's (upadated in step 5) new context with SetThreadContext.
	7. Resume the hijacked thread with ResumeThread.

- Tested on Win10 x86/64 works fine.	
- The shellcode below is a messagebox
```
